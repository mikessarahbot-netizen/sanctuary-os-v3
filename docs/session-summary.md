## 2026-06-16 11:50 EDT · feature/foundation-monorepo-scaffold

Tasks completed:
- Re-synced with `agents.md`, product vision, system map, engineering rules, ChurchContext schema, API plan, Planning plan, and active task file.
- Verified existing scaffold work for `apps/api`, `packages/church-context`, and `packages/db`.
- Verified `origin` is configured as `https://github.com/mikessarahbot-netizen/sanctuary-os-v3.git`.
- Verified `feature/foundation-monorepo-scaffold` is pushed to `origin`.
- Re-ran scaffold release checks: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, and `git ls-remote --heads origin feature/foundation-monorepo-scaffold`.
- Updated the architecture release-check report to mark push readiness as passing.

Next task:
- Implement the first approved module slice from the scaffolded contracts.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-06-16 12:17 EDT · feature/planning-readiness-domain

Tasks completed:
- Re-synced with `agents.md`, active task state, session summary, Planning plan, API plan, and current API source files.
- Implemented Planning GraphQL schema/type contract placeholders in `apps/api/src/graphql/planning.ts`.
- Added thin Planning mutation resolver contracts that parse GraphQL-style `{ input }` args, attach `AuthenticatedActor` and `requestId` from context, and delegate to Planning command/readiness services.
- Kept GraphQL work adapter-free: no persistence, UI, vendor integrations, or AI setlist implementation.
- Added tests proving planned mutation names are represented, resolver delegation preserves actor/request context, readiness refresh delegates to the readiness service, and invalid publish input is rejected before service delegation.
- Ran and passed `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test`.

Next task:
- Implement Planning persistence repository contracts for service commands.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-06-16 12:06 EDT · feature/planning-readiness-domain

Tasks completed:
- Created `feature/planning-readiness-domain` from the pushed foundation scaffold branch.
- Implemented Planning readiness domain contracts in `apps/api/src/domain/planning/`.
- Implemented pure readiness scoring with required-role, confirmation, service-plan, song-asset, rehearsal-asset, and CCLI checks.
- Added `readiness.updated` payload validation in the API events boundary.
- Implemented `createPlanningReadinessService` with Planning role checks, tenant-scope guards, persistence boundary calls, and post-commit event publication.
- Added domain, service, and API export tests.
- Ran and passed `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test`.
- Committed and pushed `d05f4c1 feat(planning): add readiness domain service`.

Next task:
- Implement Planning service command contracts.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-06-16 12:11 EDT · feature/planning-readiness-domain

Tasks completed:
- Re-synced with `agents.md`, product vision, system map, engineering rules, `05-plans/api-plan.md`, `05-plans/planning-module-plan.md`, active task state, and the prior session summary.
- Implemented Zod-validated Planning command schemas for create/update service, add/update/reorder service items, assign volunteer, and update assignment status.
- Added Planning command service/repository interfaces with `AuthenticatedActor` command boundaries, actor tenant scope forwarding, Planning role gates, returned-record tenant/service mismatch guards, and explicit confirmation intent for publish/cancel service updates.
- Added validated `service.published` and `assignment.statusChanged` event payload contracts and post-command event publication.
- Added focused command tests for confirmation validation, tenant scope, role gates, cross-tenant rejection, and validated event publication.
- Verified `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test` pass.

Next task:
- Implement Planning GraphQL schema/resolver contracts that delegate to the service layer.

Open questions:
- None.

## 2026-06-16 12:10 EDT · feature/planning-readiness-domain

Tasks completed:
- Re-synced with `agents.md`, product vision, system map, engineering rules, `05-plans/api-plan.md`, `05-plans/planning-module-plan.md`, and active task state.
- Continued from the scaffold handoff on `feature/planning-readiness-domain`.
- Added Planning readiness domain schemas and deterministic readiness scoring in `apps/api`.
- Added the `refreshReadinessScore` service boundary with Zod command validation, Planning role checks, tenant mismatch guards, repository save contract, and validated `readiness.updated` event publication.
- Added focused tests for scoring, event payload validation, service authorization, tenant mismatch, and publication behavior.
- Verified `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test` pass.

Next task:
- Implement Planning service command contracts.

Open questions:
- None.
